AI Testbed User Guide
Contributing to Documentation

Python environment

To build documentation locally, you need a Python environment with mkdocs installed. Check that Python 3.6+ is installed:

$ python --version
Python 3.8.3
Then create a new virtual env to isolate the mkdocs installation:

$ python -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
Git

Using Git ssh. Make sure you add ssh public key to your profile (https cloning to be deprecated soon)

$ git clone git@github.com:argonne-lcf/ai-testbed-userdocs.git

Installing Mkdocs

To install mkdocs in the current environment:

$ cd ai-testbed-userdocs
$ make install-dev
Preview the Docs Locally

Run mkdocs serve or make serve to auto-build and serve the docs for preview in your web browser.

$ make serve
Working on documentation

All commits must have the commit comment
Create your own branch from the main branch. For this writing we are using YOURBRANCH as an example.
$ cd ai-testbed-userdocs
$ git fetch --all
$ git checkout main
$ git pull origin main
$ git checkout -b YOURBRANCH
$ git push -u origin YOURBRANCH
Commit your changes to the remote repo
$ cd alcf-userguide
$ git status                         # check the status of the files you have editted
$ git commit -a -m "Updated docs"    # preferably one issue per commit
$ git status                         # should say working tree clean
$ git push origin YOURBRANCH         # push YOURBRANCH to origin
$ git checkout main                  # move to the local main
$ git pull origin main               # pull the remote main to your local machine
$ git checkout YOURBRANCH            # move back to your local branch
$ git merge main                     # merge the local develop into **YOURBRANCH** and
                                     # make sure NO merge conflicts exist
$ git push origin YOURBRANCH         # push the changes from local branch up to your remote branch
Create merge request from https://github.com/argonne-lcf/ai-testbed-userdocs from YOURBRANCH to main branch.
