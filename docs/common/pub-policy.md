# Publication Policy

To publish technical reports and research papers using the ALCF AI testbeds, please provide us with a draft of your paper prior to submission by emailing a copy to support@alcf.anl.gov. We will work closely with the AI testbed vendors to provide feedback in a timely manner. We strongly recommend that you engage us and the vendors `early` and `often` in this process to help us facilitate your research objectives.
