# Publication Policy

To publish technical reports and research papers using the ALCF AI testbeds, please provide us with a draft of your paper for review prior to submission by emailing a copy to support@alcf.anl.gov. We will work closely with our AI testbed vendors to review and provide feedback in a timely manner. We strongly recommend that you engage us and the vendors `early` and `often` in this process to help us facilitate your research objectives.
