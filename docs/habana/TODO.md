# TODO

- [X] For PyTorch multi-card, what was the basic test? Is this with Horovod?
- [X] It would be good to understand what the script provided does to enable this?
- [X] Next, Can we test a tensorflow multi-card example?
- [X] PyT, have we captured the virtual env needed to run both single and multi-card examples. If not, can we?
- [ ] TF, have we captured the virtual env needed to run both single and multi-card examples. If not, can we?
- [ ] Can we test and document how users should check the number of available resources on the node so that they can use this as a parameter to run a multi-card application? How does one specify this would be good to understand as well. ...hl-smi...

## TensorBoard

Can we build an example and doc with using tensorboard?

## Notes

From a software perspective, Gaudi scaling with data parallelism in the PyTorch framework is achieved with torch.distributed package using DDP - Distributed Data Parallel [Pytorch Scaling Guide](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/PyTorch/PyTorch_Scaling_Guide/Overview.html)
