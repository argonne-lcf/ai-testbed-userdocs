# ALCF AI Testbed

ALCF provides an infrastructure for the next-generation of AI-accelerator
machines. 

The AI Testbed aims to help evaluate the usability and performance of machine learning-based high-performance computing applications running on these accelerators. The goal is to better understand how to integrate with existing and upcoming supercomputers at the facility to accelerate science insights.

You can find more information about the available systems on this [link](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/alcf-ai-testbed). Here you can find the documentation on how to use these systems. The
documentation is based on [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and source files are
on [GitHub](https://github.com/argonne-lcf/ai-testbed-userdocs). You can
contribute to the documentation by creating a pull request.
