### How to setup your base environment
[Is there anything to do here for Cerebras?]<br>
[Maybe add a zero or two to the default HISTSIZE and HISTFILESIZE in .bashrc?]<br>
.bashrc:HISTSIZE=1000000<br>
.bashrc:HISTFILESIZE=2000000<br>

maybe add **"umask 077"** to .profile to make new dirs/files user-only by default?
