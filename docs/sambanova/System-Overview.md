# System Overview

## Introduction

The SambaNova DataScale SN30 system is architected around the next-generation Reconfigurable Dataflow Unit (RDU) processor for optimal dataflow processing and acceleration. The AI Testbed's SambaNova  DataScale SN30 system consists of eight SN30-8 nodes, each of which features eight RDUs interconnected to enable model and data parallelism. Each SN30-8 node has 8 TB total memory usable by its RDUs. SambaFlow, its software stack, extracts, optimizes, and maps dataflow graphs to the RDUs from standard machine learning frameworks, like PyTorch.
