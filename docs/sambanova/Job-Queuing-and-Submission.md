# Job Queueing and Submission 

<!---
**NOTE:Â  Please be mindful of how you use the systems.
For example, run larger jobs in the evening or on weekends.**

**NOTE:  Jobs on AI Accelerators *SHOULD NOT* be run interactively.
Jobs should be run using either *srun* or *sbatch*.**

## Introduction

SambaNova uses slurm for job submission and queueing. Below are some of the important commands for using Slurm. For more information refer to <a href="https://slurm.schedmd.com/">Slurm Documentation</a> 

Note: Run the python scripts using srun or sbatch, to ensure that concurrent jobs do not interfere with each other.

## srun

The slurm command `srun` can be used to run individual python scripts in parallel on a cluster managed by slurm. In this case `srun` creates a resource allocation to run the job in parallel. Usage of `srun` examples are shown below. 
```bash
srun python lenet.py compile -b=1 --pef-name="lenet" --output-folder="pef"
srun python lenet.py test --pef="pef/lenet/lenet.pef"
srun python lenet.py run --pef="pef/lenet/lenet.pef"
```

## sbatch
Alternatively, these jobs can be submitted to the slurm through a batch script by using `sbatch` command. To do this, create a bash script (submit-lenet-job.sh here as an example) with the following contents. 

```bash
#!/bin/sh

python lenet.py compile -b=1 --pef-name="lenet" --output-folder="pef"
python lenet.py test --pef="pef/lenet/lenet.pef"
python lenet.py run --pef="pef/lenet/lenet.pef"
```

Then pass the bash script as an input to the `sbatch` command as shown below. 
```bash
sbatch --output=pef/lenet/output.log submit-lenet-job.sh
```

In case of the need to use multiple RDU's (2 in the example shown below), the `sbatch` command would be altered as:
```bash
sbatch --gres=rdu:2 <your_script.sh>
```

## squeue
`Squeue` command provides information about jobs located in the Slurm scheduling queue. 

```bash
squeue
```

## scancel
Scancel is used to signal or cancel jobs, job arrays or job steps.

```bash
scancel job_id
```
