**NOTE:  Please be mindful of how you are using the system.
For example, consider running larger jobs in the evening or on weekends.**

Running basic Graphcore models is the same on this system as it would be

```bash
cd ~/graphcore/tutorials/simple_applications/pytorch/mnist
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python mnist_poptorch.py
```
